# Image_bg_remover
Image Background Remover built using Tensorflow.





# Background-Removal-using-Deep-Learning

The repository contains the code for removing the background of a human from images using deep learning (semantic segmentation)

This project is mostly focused on removing background of images which contains humans.

The model used is a pretrained model.
